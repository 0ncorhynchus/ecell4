Welcome to E-Cell System version 4 documentation!
=================================================

What is E-Cell System?
----------------------

E-Cell System is a software platform for modeling, simulation and
analysis of complex, heterogeneous and multi-scale systems like the
cell.

E-Cell4 is a free and open-source software licensed under the GNU
General Public License version 2.

The source code is available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/ecell/ecell4>`__.

For installation instructions, please see :doc:`installation`. E-Cell4 runs on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

4.0.1 (Released May 20, 2016)
-----------------------------------

Enhancement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Progressbar on Jupyter Notebook
- Better styles for visualization especially for matplotlib
- A member function to distinguish Species for molecules and structures
- Enable user-defined macros for Python decorators
- Enable to save a movie as mp4
- Enable to set tolerances for ODE through a Factory class
- 2D visualization of 3D world for animation
- getVelocity for ODE simulation
- Implicit dissolution of bindings in the rule-based modeling
- Higher resolution for plot_movie
- Enable to save time course data of NumberObservers
- FixedIntervalTrajectoryObserver should have its small interval to check the periodic boundary effect separately from logging interval
- Convenient functions for declaring fundamental objects
- Enable to set ranges to show trajectories on viz.plot_trajectory

Bug fix
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed kernel death that would occur when there is no species in the viz.plot_movie_with_matplotlib(..., species_list)
- Implement egfrd::World::list_species()
- Spatiocyte doesn't accept the second-order reaction with translocation
- Wrong absorption rate for mesoscopic simulations
