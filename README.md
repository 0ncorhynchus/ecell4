What is E-Cell System?
----------------------

E-Cell System is, a software platform for modeling, simulation and analysis of complex, heterogeneous and multi-scale systems like the cell.
E-Cell has multi-algorithm, multi-timescale and multi-spatial-representation as its central feature.

Quick start
===========

You can try E-Cell4 without installing it on your computer’s hard drive.

You can do this by just clicking [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/ecell/ecell4-notebooks).

All you need to do is just running the cells in each of the example Jupyter notebooks.

Installation
------------

### Requirements

#### Minimum requirements

- Python (2.7 and 3.4, 3.5 both major versions are supported [3.4 is only supported on Linux])
- pip (8.1 or later)
- hdf5 (required only on **Windows**.)

#### Optional requirements

We strongly recommend that you run E-Cell4 with [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).
Some E-Cell4 functions (for visualization, datastore) optionally depend on

- matplotlib (**1.5.1** or later)
- ffmpeg
- pandas

### Windows

We recommend that you install [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) to manage Python packages.
**Note that we do not support Python2.7 64bit for Windows.**

- Install Miniconda for Windows from http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html
- Run the following commands on command prompt

    ```shell
    conda install hdf5 matplotlib notebook
    pip install ecell
    ```

- (**Important**) E-Cell4 for Windows needs the latest `hdf5`. If there's any problem, please update the version of hdf5.

    ```shell
    conda update hdf5
    ```

If you use animated visualization with E-Cell4, please install [ffmpeg windows build](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) and add its path to your **USER** PATH enviromental variable.

### Mac or Linux

We recommend that you install [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) to manage Python packages.
After installing Miniconda, run the following commands in your terminal.

```shell
# After installing Miniconda2 or Miniconda3 (Here we assume that you installed Miniconda3).
~/miniconda3/bin/conda install matplotlib notebook

# Download E-Cell4 whl file for your Python version from https://github.com/ecell/ecell4/releases before running this command.
~/miniconda3/bin/pip install ecell

# If you want animation support, install ffmpeg with homebrew
brew install ffmpeg
# or if you use Ubuntu Linux
# apt install ffmpeg
```

How to try E-Cell4 examples
---------------------------
Here we download example notebooks from https://github.com/ecell/ecell4-notebooks and open it with Jupyter Notebook.

### Windows
Open powershell and run these commands.
Here we assume that you installed Miniconda(Python3.5) to C:¥Miniconda3

```shell
cd C:¥Miniconda3¥Scripts
wget https://github.com/ecell/ecell4-notebooks/archive/master.zip -OutFile master.zip
Expand-Archive master.zip
.¥jupyter-notebook.exe .¥master¥ecell4-notebooks-master¥
```

### Mac or Linux
Here we assume that you installed Miniconda(Python3.5) to ~/miniconda3

```shell
wget https://github.com/ecell/ecell4-notebooks/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd ecell4-notebooks-master
~/miniconda3/bin/jupyter-notebook
```

Simple examples
---------------

Here are two extremely simple examples, See http://ecell4.readthedocs.org for more details on running E-Cell4.

```
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from ecell4.core import *
>>> sp = Species("B.A.C")
>>> print(sp.serial())
B.A.C
>>>
```

### A reversible binding reaction

```python
%matplotlib inline
import numpy
from ecell4 import *

with reaction_rules():
    A + B == C | (0.01, 0.3)

y = run_simulation(
    numpy.linspace(0, 10, 100), {'A': 60, 'B': 60}, solver='ode')
```

### Particle tracking on a spherical surface

```python
%matplotlib inline
from ecell4 import *

with species_attributes():
    A | {'D': '1', 'location': 'M'}

surface = Sphere(ones() * 0.5, 0.5).surface()
obs = FixedIntervalTrajectoryObserver(1e-4)
run_simulation(
    0.4, y0={'A': 10}, structures={'M': surface},
    solver='spatiocyte', observers=obs, return_type=None)

viz.plot_trajectory(obs, interactive=False)
```

Docker image for E-Cell4
----------------------------

You can pull E-Cell4 docker image with `docker pull ecell/ecell4`.
This image includes E-Cell4 and its example Jupyter notebooks.

You need to set up your password or get a token to login there.
E-Cell4 docker image is based on `jupyter/minimal-notebook`. 
See https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/minimal-notebook for more details about the `docker run` options.

### Password auth

You need to install IPython and create a hashed password before running the docker image.
(Here we use miniconda IPython as an example.)
```
~/miniconda3/bin/ipython
Python 3.5.2 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:52:12) 
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

IPython 5.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
%quickref -> Quick reference.
help      -> Python's own help system.
object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

In [1]: from IPython.lib.security import passwd

In [2]: passwd()
Enter password: 
Verify password: 
Out[2]: 'sha1:78345db65767:e156e28013d2f6741a042c44fcc12d21af7b7529'
```

And run the docker image with
```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 ecell/ecell4 start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.password='sha1:78345db65767:e156e28013d2f6741a042c44fcc12d21af7b7529'
```

You can see E-Cell4 example Jupyter notebooks after opening `http://localhost:8888` and login.

### Token auth

First run the docker image with
```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 ecell/ecell4
```
Then get the container name with `docker ps` command
```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
f2109e17eb55        ecell/ecell4        "tini -- start-notebo"   40 minutes ago      Up 40 minutes       0.0.0.0:8888->8888/tcp   peaceful_panini
```
And get the token for the container with the follwoing command, in the above case the container ID is `peaceful_panini`.
```
docker exec -it peaceful_panini jupyter notebook list
Currently running servers:
http://localhost:8888/?token=d8872dc7e0d5bd78882dcc326255f9848db24fd1a40711af :: /home/jovyan/work
```
In this case, the token is `d8872dc7e0d5bd78882dcc326255f9848db24fd1a40711af`

By using this token, you can login to the Jupyter Notebook service (`http://localhost:8888`).
