About this package
========================

This package is temporarily named E-Cell Particle Dynamics Prototype
(EPDP).  It currently implements the enhanced Greens Function Reaction
Dynamics (eGFRD) and brute-force Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulation
algorithms.  Implementation of the original version of GFRD will possibly
be added in future.  The code is implemented with the hope that it will
eventually be ported to the E-Cell System Version 4 to become part of
the multi-algorithm, multi-space simulation platform.

The eGFRD algorithm is described in the following paper:
K. Takahashi, S. Tanase-Nicola, P.R. ten Wolde, 2008 (unpublished).
