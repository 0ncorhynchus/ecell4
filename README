About this package
========================

This package is temporarily named Particle Dynamics Platform Prototype
(PDPP).  It currently implements the enhanced Greens Function Reaction
Dynamics (eGFRD) simulation algorithm.  Implementation of brute-force
Brownian Dynamics (BD) and the original version of GFRD is in
progress.  The code is implemented with the hope that it will
eventually be ported to the E-Cell System Version 4 to become part of
the multi-algorithm, multi-space simulation platform.

The eGFRD algorithm is described in the following paper:
K. Takahashi, S. Tanase-Nicola, P.R. ten Wolde, 2008 (unpublished).
