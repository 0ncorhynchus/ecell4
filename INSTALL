Prerequisites
-------------------------

1. autotools
   (autoconf, automake, libtool)
2. GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
3. Boost C++ Library 1.34 or later.
4. Python 2.4 or later.
5. Scipy 0.5 or later, Numpy 1.0 or later.
6. Matplotlib if you want to use the plotting programs used in sample
   scripts.
(7. Pychecker if you want to run 'make pycheck'.)

If you use Fedora or any other RedHat lines of linux, check
if the following RPM packages are installed:

gsl, gsl-devel, numpy, scipy, python-matplotlib, boost, and boost-devel.

On Ubuntu Linux and some other Debian families, install the following:

gsl-bin, libgsl0, libgsl0-dev, libboost-dev, libboost-python-dev,
libboost-test-dev, python-scipy, python-matplotlib.

Tested on Fedora 7 and Ubuntu 7.10.


A note on GSL version
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GSL version 1.10 has at least two bugs that can causes an abnormal
program exit when a Bessel function is evaluated with specific argument
values.  These bugs can seriously hit stability of this software.

As of January 2008, one of these two bugs is fixed in the official CVS
repository of the GSL project.  
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2007-10/msg00010.html

The other is not addressed yet by GSL developers, but a report has
been made as below.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2007-12/msg00000.html

A temporary remedy to this problem is to modify the code as below;

1. Open the GSL source file specfunc/bessel.c
2. Find the function named gsl_sf_bessel_J_CF1() around line 485.
3. Find the following line:
   const int maxiter = 10000;
4. Increase the number.  For example,
   const int maxiter = 100000;
5. Rebuild and install GSL.


Building this package
-------------------------

1. ./autogen.sh (optional)
2. ./configure
3. make

Testing
-------------------

Running

% make check

provides a means to make sure some of the core components of the software
are running correctly.

In addition, you may run

% make pycheck

if you want to be super-strict about Python syntax.


Running
-------------------------

Go to subdirectories under doc/samples, and read README files there.
